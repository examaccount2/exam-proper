6. Ireland reaches lowest greenhouse emissions in 30 years
Governments and organizations have been committing to climate initiatives for decades, and more of these commitments are starting to pay off over time. In 2023, Ireland accomplished its lowest greenhouse gas emissions since 1990. 

Ireland had previously committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions with increased renewables, reduced fossil fuels in home heating, and sustainability improvements in agriculture. 2023 emissions decreased by 6.7 per cent across almost all sectors. 

Most notably, its targeted energy and agriculture sectors experienced the largest decreases:

Power generation emissions: - 21.6 per cent
Residential emissions: -7.1 per cent
Agriculture emissions: - 4.6 per cent
Transport emissions: -0.3 per cent


These are positive results for Ireland, but the fight isn’t over. Laura Burke, Director General of Ireland’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said:

The data indicates a move towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the scale and pace required to meet our climate ambition of a 51 per cent reduction by 2030. However, while these are positive results for the year 2023, we are still well off track in terms of meeting EU and national 2030 targets. We need to maintain and further build momentum.
