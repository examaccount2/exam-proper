9. Hawaii Replaced Its Last Coal Plant With A Battery
With a giant battery replacing the stateâ€™s last coal plant, Hawaii is a leading example of how grid functions can be switched from fossil-fueled plants to clean energy. 

As clean energy continues to grow in popularity, many individuals remain skeptical. How can a grid function reliably without fossil fuels? Is clean energy reliable enough?

Hawaii is answering that question for everyone: yes, you can have a functional grid without fossil fuels. You just need a giant battery. Instead of generating power, the battery system absorbs it from the grid and delivers cheap, sustainable energy when required.
