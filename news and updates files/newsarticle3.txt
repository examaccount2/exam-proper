3. The Green Deal successfully limits temperature increases
The UN’s Paris Agreement aims to cap global temperature increases at 1.5°C by 2050 with global adoption of sustainability measures. Hitting this temperature limit can reverse the most significant impacts of climate change and prevent further damage. 

The European Union committed to this goal with the 2019 Green Deal, which includes policies to expand renewable energy, set new standards for car emissions, and reform existing and introduce new EU emissions trading systems. 

In the years since the Green Deal agreement, the EU has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions so significantly that it’s now expected to reach a low 3°C temperature increase by 2030 – an over 1 point decrease from the 4°C+ estimate with 2019 policies. That’s also a 51 per cent reduction of emissions from the 1990s levels.

While this is still shy of the Paris Agreement’s 2050 goals, it is on target to limit temperature increases to 2°C by the end of the century. And this enormous increase in European commitments and clear improvements via tangible actions show positive momentum towards global goals. Especially considering Europe is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitting regions in the world.
