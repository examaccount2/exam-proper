7. Renewable wind and solar energy ousts fossil fuels in EU and US
The European Union and the United States have made their own efforts to reduce emissions with increased renewable energy, and as of 2024, wind and solar sources officially outpace fossil fuels. 

In the EU, wind and solar energy currently account for 30 per cent of electricity generation. While that’s just 3 points higher than the fossil fuel share, there’s also been a 17 per cent decrease in fossil fuel generation. All of this as energy demand increased by 0.7 per cent during the same period. 

These changes are driven in part by the European Green Deal, which has continued to evolve over the years. The EU Commission oversees European Green Deal commitments with support from organizations such as FSC, which provides guidance for forestry sustainability. For example, FSC provided feedback on forest bioenergy as a renewable energy and opportunities to strengthen REDII Sustainability Criteria regarding this source.

The U.S. reached this milestone in the first half of 2023 by a difference of 3 terawatt-hours, with wind and solar production 252 terawatt-hours. This is largely a result of decreased coal production, which decreased 27 per cent between 2022 and 2023. 

At a global scale, there are officially 8 countries that rely on renewable energy for over 90 per cent of their power. This includes Albania, Bhutan, Iceland, Nepal, Paraguay, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Netherlands.
