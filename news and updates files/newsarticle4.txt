4. Sustainably managed forests support biodiversity and climate resilience
Thriving ecosystems and healthy forests, from Brazilian rainforests to Siberian taiga, are essential support systems for life on Earth and climate resilience. 

To a newcomer, managing the health of Earth’s forests feels at odds with increased production and agriculture needs to support a growing global population. But it shouldn’t be.

More individuals and corporations are recognizing that forest stewardship is key to a sustainable future. Well-maintained forests help combat climate change, and they facilitate the well-being of people, particularly Indigenous Peoples, and the planet as a whole. 

It’s not just about access to food and natural resources, either. Between 2001-2019, global forests removed about twice as much carbon dioxide from the Earth’s atmosphere as they emitted annually. 

Organizations like FSC are committed to protecting forest futures by: 

Addressing biodiversity loss
Improving sustainable raw material extraction for forestry products like lumber and rubber 
Prioritizing ethical and sustainable supply chain practices
Advocating for forest protections, climate initiatives, and the rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
The Huong Son State Forest Company in Vietnam is one example of how forest stewardship acts as a defence against climate change.

Vietnam’s Ha Tinh prince includes over 20,000 hectares of forest — home to over 2,300 plant and animal species. In just 15 years, this region has lost over 1,000 hectares of its forest land. This kind of loss has a significant impact on the region’s biodiversity. 

The forests outside of Huong Son are now FSC Certified, with over 40 rangers patrolling the land each day. Commitments to improve forest conservation, monitoring, and ecosystem services in forests has helped the forest sequester 727,435 tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere between 2015 and 2020. 

This further supports the idea that FSC standards help forests thrive.
