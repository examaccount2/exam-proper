8. The EU votes to criminalize environmental damages 
Finally, the EU is putting its money where its mouth is and has voted to criminalize environmental damages. This provides an updated directive for countries to identify and prosecute serious crimes comparable to “ecocide.”

This can include significant habitat or biodiversity loss, illegal logging, and more. 

The directive also updates punishments to push for harder penalties and even time in prison for environmental crimes. 

Further, a European Court of Human Rights has declared that climate inaction is actually a violation of human rights. 

The case specifically cites that Switzerland’s climate initiatives were inadequate, and that specific groups of people were particularly vulnerable to climate impacts like heat waves. 

Not only is this a powerful move towards true, actionable climate legislation. But decisions like the EU court’s call that governments have a human rights-driven responsibility towards climate action may influence countries across Europe and the world to make a move.

Ultimately, legislation like this is promoting personal responsibility from businesses to correct actions that negatively impact the environment and human well-being. Something supported by mitigation hierarchy — a framework for businesses to correct harmful actions against the environment across their value chain. 

Mitigation hierarchy follows a few key steps:

Avoid unnecessary negative environmental impacts from direct operations. For example, a construction company sourcing FSC certified lumber.
Reduce negative impacts that aren’t avoidable, like choosing a coffee roaster supplier that uses less fertiliser than other suppliers. 
Restore habitats, communities, and material sources that can’t be avoided or reduced. This can include financial support, advocacy, and continued process evaluation and development.
